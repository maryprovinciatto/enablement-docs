# Contributing

Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to contribute. This project relies on an active and involved community, and we really appreciate your support.

## Code of Conduct

This project is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All participants are expected to uphold this code. Violations of the code can be reported by contacting the project team at
[rhc-open-innovation-labs@redhat.com](mailto:rhc-open-innovation-labs@redhat.com).

## How to contribute

Fork the repo, add or change markdown files, and create a pull request. You can make these changes via the GitHub web interface, the command line, or a git client of your choice.

# How we work together

We're using the "optimistic merging" strategy to make contributing simple and enjoyable.

1. To propose a change, log an issue.
2. Seek consensus on the value of that change.
  - Give the community a day or two to provide feedback on your issue.
  - If the feedback is mostly positive, move forward.
  - If you don't get any feedback after a day or two, move forward.
3. Create a pull request to make the change described in the issue.
4. The maintainer review the PR to determine whether it is a "correct patch". That means the PR:
  - Solves one "identified and agreed problem"
  - Clearly explains the problem and the proposed solution
  - Builds without errors, warnings, or test failures
  - Does not break our Code of Conduct  
5. If the PR is a "correct patch", the maintainer merges the PR. If not, the maintainer provides feedback.

If the person reviewing the PR has feedback on a change that is a "correct patch", he or she will merge the PR and include that feedback in a new issue.

To learn more, see [Why Optimistic Merging Works Better](http://hintjens.com/blog:106) and [Collective Code Construction Contract (C4)](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/) from Pieter Hintjens, who coined the term "optimistic merging". The Open Practice Library community has discussed this way of working in #208.

This workflow is still being refined and improved. If you have feedback, feel free to get in touch.
