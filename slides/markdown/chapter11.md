## User Story Mapping



### User Stories
#### _What are They?_
* A promise to create a conversation
  * Card
  * Conversation
  * Confirmation
* Enough Detail to give direction for completion
* Provide value to the end consumer



### User Stories
#### _User stories should be..._
* **I**ndependent
* **N**egotiable
* **V**aluable
* **E**stimable
* **S**mall
* **T**estable



#### SHARED DOCUMENTATION &#8800; SHARED UNDERSTANDING

### User Story Mapping
#### _What is It?_
* Frame the opportunity, goal, outcome, and value.
* Tell the story of the product from left to right (user steps).
* Go back and talk about and capture the details of each step.



#### PRODUCT SLICING GONE BAD!

### Exercise - Mapping Stories for "getting to work"
1. As an individual, capture on stickies things you do from the moment you wake up
until you arrive at work.



### Exercise - Mapping Stories for "getting to work"
1. As an individual, capture on stickies things you do from the moment you wake up
until you arrive at work.
2. As a team, add all activities to the story map and remove duplicates. If some are similar but slightly different, do not remove as duplicates

3. Cluster similar activities and capture themes above them

## Value Slicing



### Value Slicing
#### _What Is It?_
The goal of **value slicing** is to divide user stories into iterations such
that it forms the outline of a plan. Usually the first iteration builds a
minimally viable product.

### Exercise - Value Slicing for "getting to work"
Scenario: You woke up late and you must get to an early morning meeting at work
and cannot miss it. What **must** you do to prepare for work and get there on time?

1. As a team, draw a line on the user story mapping board representing what
must be done.
2. Discuss which stories are absolutely necessary given the scenario.
3. Move stories below the line that are not absolutely necessary based on
consensus of the team.

## Empathy Mapping



### Empathy Mapping
#### _What Is It?_
* A tool to capture and visualize what key stakeholders are sensing when in a
particular context or completing a set of tasks.
* A way to form a better understanding of users and build personas
* Information is captured directly from interviews, observations, and other
facilitated conversation exercises.
* Senses captured can include what the person is seeing, thinking, doing, and feeling.
* Originated from Dave Gray of [XPLANE](http://www.xplane.com/)



### Empathy Mapping

### Empathy Mapping
#### _Why Use It?_
* Captures information and learning directly from the end user affected by the
system/application/solution in question.
* Enables a direct connection between important stakeholders and developers, e.g.
developers of an application can learn directly from end users using it.
* The tool identifies pain points, opportunities, and starts to form a basis for
improvement and optimization.
* The tool can be used to move from user empathy to value propositions.



## Empathy Mapping Demonstration



### Summary
#### _How do we form the user story map for value slicing?_
* Use the commands from **event storming**
* Use the ideas surfaced from **metric-based process mapping**
* Capture interactions with users and key stakeholders:
  * User interviews
  * Research
  * **Empathy Mapping** of users
  * **Empathy Mapping** of developers and operations people
